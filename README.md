# IPL-Data-Analysis-and-Machine-Learning

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India conducted by Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) contested during March or April and May of every year by Ten Teams representing Ten different cities in India.The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2008. The IPL has an exclusive window in ICC Future Tours Programme. Currenly it's 16th season of IPL. As finally, this year IPL Season 16 is going to start on 31-03-2023[31st March 2023]. The cricket mood is on. While planning to watch the first match itself, the idea of analyzing IPL dataset struck my mind and luckily I found one dataset on Kaggle which contains the data of matches held between 2008-2020. So, I shall be analyzing that dataset only. Hope you like my work.

## About Analysis
The basic idea of analyzing the IPL dataset is to get a fair idea about the Teams Record and Stats and also record and stats of individual players. With each year new season is starting the all people are keen to observe the stats how well they performed and how they will be able to perform in the upcoming season. All Cricket expert are always observe record and stats. It will be helpfull for Fantasy games like Dream 11,My 11 Circle etc because based on the record and stats we can analyse the players ability to whom to choose in Fantasy games

In this work I am going answer the major question to analyse the data better
